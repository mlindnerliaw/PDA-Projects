# PDA-Project-1

This project conducts a thorough exploratory data analysis of marathon data from 5 US marathons from the years 1993 to 2016. The data set contains race location, year, sex of runner, finishing time as percent course record, and weather condition variables including wet, dry, and black globe temperatures, relative huidity, and solar radiation. The goal of the EDA is to explore the effect of increasing age on marathon performance in both sexes, investigate whether weather conditions affect finishing times and whether those effect differ by sex and age, and determine which weather parameters have the largest impact on marathon performance.   

The Code folder contains all code used to generate this report. The `Marathon_data_preprocess` file contains all of the initial cleaning and preprocessing. The `Missing_data` file contains the code used to analyse the missing data. The `Get_year_range` file contains the code to get the year ranges for each race, and the `Tables_and_Figures` file contains all of the code to generate the tables and figures in the report. 

The `PDA-Project-1` file contains the PDF of the final report.  

For all analysis, the R version 4.1.2 was used.
