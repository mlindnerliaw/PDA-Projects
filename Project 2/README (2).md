## PDA Project 2: Regression Analysis

This project conducts a regression analysis on data from the Hitsman et. al. study comparing the effect of behavioral and pharmaceutical treatments on smoking cessation in subjects with major depressive disorder (MDD). The data set includes demographic variables such as age, race, income, and education, and smoking and mental health measures such as cigarettes smoked per day, FTCD score, depression score, anhedosis score, menthol cigarette use, and quit readiness. The goal of the analysis was to determine potential moderators for the effect of behavioral treatment among the baseline variables, as well as examine the baseline variables as predictors for smoking abstinence. 


The PDAProject2.rmd contains all code written for this report, and the PDAProject2.pdf file contains the rendered report. 

For all analysis, the R version 4.1.2 was used.
